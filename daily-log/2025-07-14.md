# Day 2 - 2025-07-14

## âœ… What I did today

- Installed the 'pandas' library using pip
- Wrote a Python script('csv_cleaner.py') to clean csv data
- Handled duplicates and missing data using pandas library
- Saved clean data to a new file
- Organized the script inside '03_pandas/'
- Stored input/output files in the 'data/' folder
- Committed and pushed all changes to GitHub

## What I learned

- How to install Python packages using pip
- How to read, clean and write CSVs using 'pandas'
- How to use 'os.path' for flexible file paths
- better understanding of Git commit & push flow

## Next steps

- Add logging to the CSV cleaner script
- Make file paths configurable (e.g., via command-line arguments)
- Explore more pandas functions (e.g., renaming columns, filtering rows)
